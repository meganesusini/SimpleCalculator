IF we press the AC button THEN input.value = 0

let calculation = "";

WHILE we DON'T press the equal button THEN :
    IF ONCLICK a button THEN :
        calculation += button.value;
        input.value = calculation;

For the calculation

Create the functions which make a calculation depending on the operator

Create an function which detect the * or the /

For example : 1+2*1*2-1
We need to :
- find the index of all the operators :
    here : [+1 : 1, *2 : 3, *3: 5, -4 : 7]
- find the * or the /
    here : [*2 : 3]
- find if there is an operator before this *2 -> search if there is a value less than the 2* value
    - if there is a value less than the 2* value then :
        select the calculation by : calculation[]
