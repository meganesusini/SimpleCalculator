IF we press the AC button THEN input.value = 0

let calculation = "";

WHILE we DON'T press the equal button THEN :
    IF ONCLICK a button THEN :
        calculation += button.value;
        input.value = calculation;

For the calculation

Create the functions which make a calculation depending on the operator

Create an function which detect the * or the /

For example : 1+2*1*2-1
We need to :
- how many operators there are :
    - if there is one operator -> do the calculation
    - else :
        - check if there is an ope * or / :
            - if no :
                - select the operation from the beggining to the second index ope-1
                - do the calculation
                - var calculation = result + [index ope to end]
                - check if there is an other ope
                    - if yes :
                        - repeat the precedent operation
                    - if no :
                        - do the calculation
            - if yes :
                - check if the ope is the first ope :
                    - if yes :
                        - select the operation from the beggining to the second index ope-1
                        - do the calculation
                        - var calculation = result + [index ope to end]
                        - check if there is an other ope * or / :
                            - if no :
                                - repeat the precendent operation
                            if yes :
                                - check if the ope is the first ope :
                                    - if yes -> repeat the precedent operation
                                    - if no :
                                        - select the index of the precedent ope
                                        - add +1 to the index
                                        - check if there is an ope after your * or / ope :
                                            - if no : 
                                                - select the operation from the beggining to the second index ope-1
                                                - do the calculation
                                                - var calculation = result + [index ope to end]
                                                - then :
                                                - select the operation from the beggining to the second index ope-1
                                                - do the calculation
                                                - var calculation = result + [index ope to end]
                                                - check if there is an other ope * or / :
                                            i
